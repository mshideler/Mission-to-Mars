# Mission-to-Mars

The purpose of this project is to create a web app to display various Mars-related items that are webscraped from other websites.  The last part of the project involves using BeautifulSoup and Splinter to webscrape full-res images of Mars's hemispheres and titles, add the data to a Mongo database and add them to the web app for display.
